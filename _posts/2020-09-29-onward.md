## I did it!

On December 31st, 2019, my wife, Kara, looked at me and said, "You know, you would like programming." At the same time, [Codecademy](http://ssqt.co/mQfKjjI) was having their New Years sale. I decided to give it a go. After all, I had just had knee surgery a few months prior and was still a little laid up. I needed something to do while Kara took our toddler to the trampoline park on weekends and I had exhausted my supply of video games.

I took a quiz to see what I would like and landed on back-end development with JavaScript. Within a week, I was raving about it to everyone who would listen. I told an old friend of mine that it was like a language and a math puzzle had a baby. She's a data scientist and had some casual words of advice:

> "That's a good way to look at it. If you start doing data science stuff it starts to feel even more like that."

More math? Heck, yeah! I switched to the Data Science career path that night. My friend was right. After that, I found myself telling my wife at every step of the way, "I like this module. I think this is my favorite. I could totally do this for a living."

And so it went, me finding my next favorite thing about data science over and over again, until I got to the [OKCupid capstone project](/project/okc-analysis). It took a while with a toddler-- I felt like I was working two days on and five off--, but I guess that's what you get when you're a stay at home mom during a global pandemic. The more work I did, though, the more I wanted to do. In the end, it wound up being a behemoth of a project and I *loved* it. 

What's more? After all of that work (and the weekend to recharge and celebrate my birthday), returning to my lessons was a breeze. I finished the remainder of the Data Science career track, Natural Language Processing, in an afternoon. When I finished, the website awarded me with this cute certificate of completion.

## What's next?

Over the course of the past nine months, I collected a mountain of digital textbooks and video courses. [HumbleBundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription?refc=LT9fcU) has filled my Calibre library to the brim with 253 new books, 134 of them about math, physics, coding, data, statistics, and probability. On top of that, I have a slew of Zenva and Manning courses, CompTIA and AWS exam guides, and three months left of my Codecademy subscription. The world is my oyster.

So what will I do now? I really enjoyed both visualization and NLP. My first course of action will be to complete Codecademy's Learn Natural Language Processing course, which expands upon the NLP modules I completed in the Data Science career path. After that, I see a few immediate options:

| Learn to make interactive dashboards for visualizing data | Beef up on Bayesian Programming and NLP | Learn Tensorflow |
|--|--|--|
| Take the following courses on Codecademy: <br><br>* Learn HTML <br>* Learn CSS <br>* Learn JavaScript <br>* Learn D3 | Read the following ebooks: <br><br> * **Bayesian Programming** by Pierre Bessiere, Emmanuel Mazer, Juan-Manuel Ahuactzin, and Kamel Mekhnacha <br>* **Natural Language Processing for Social Media** by Atefeh Farzindar and Diana Inkpen <br>* **Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing** by Yoav Goldberg <br>* **Natural Language Processing with PyTorch** by Delip Rao and Brian McMahon | Take [Machine Learning for Mere Mortals](https://www.manning.com/livevideo/machine-learning-for-mere-mortals?query=machine%20learning%20for%20mere%20mort) through Manning Publications |

Now it's time to build on my knowledge further, complete more projects, and apply to jobs. I'm so proud of what I achieved in such a short period of time and I can't wait to see where this takes me.
