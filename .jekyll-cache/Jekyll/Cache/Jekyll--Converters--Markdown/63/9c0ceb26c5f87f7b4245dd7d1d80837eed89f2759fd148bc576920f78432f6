I""<h2 id="i-did-it">I did it!</h2>

<p>On December 31st, 2019, my wife, Kara, looked at me and said, “You know, you would like programming.” At the same time, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> was having their New Years sale. I decided to give it a go. After all, I had just had knee surgery a few months prior and was still a little laid up. I needed something to do while Kara took our toddler to the trampoline park on weekends and I had exhausted my supply of video games.</p>

<p>I took a quiz to see what I would like and landed on back-end development with JavaScript. Within a week, I was raving about it to everyone who would listen. I told an old friend of mine that it was like a language and a math puzzle had a baby. She’s a data scientist and had some casual words of advice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“That’s a good way to look at it. If you start doing data science stuff it starts to feel even more like that.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More math? Heck, yeah! I switched to the Data Science career path that night.</p>
