<h2 id="tennis-ace">Tennis Ace</h2>

<p>Let’s be real. I don’t have a single athletic bone in my body. So, when I was given an open-ended project on <a href="http://ssqt.co/mQfKjjI" title="Codecademy's Home Page">Codecademy</a> to analyze a <a href="https://github.com/lemonmeringuepi/Tennis-Stats/blob/master/tennis_stats.csv">tennis statistics dataset</a> using linear regression, I can safely say that my prior knowledge consisted of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s a ball and a net.</li>
  <li>Serena and Venus Williams are famous tennis players.</li>
  <li>Paul Bettany played a tennis player in the 2004 movie Wimbledon, which I watched a few times in high school and hadn’t thought of since.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I inspected my columns, I felt lost in a sea of break points and first serves… What does it all mean? Determined to make something of the data, I read up on each statistic.</p>

<h4 id="first-serves-second-serves-and-aces">First Serves, Second Serves, and Aces</h4>

<p>A serve in tennis is the initial shot to start a point. The first serve is exactly what you would think: the first attempt at getting the ball over the net. If that attempt fails, or results in a fault for one of the following reasons, the server attempts again as the second serve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ball bounces in the wrong spot or hits something that it shouldn’t, like the net</li>
  <li>The server is in an illegal position</li>
  <li>The server misses the ball entirely</li>
</ul>

<p>If the serve goes over the net into the court and the receiver is unable to hit it, that is called an ace. The server gets a point and gets to serve again.</p>

<h4 id="break-points">Break Points</h4>

<p>If a player is one point away from winning the game and their opponent is serving, this is considered a break point opportunity. If the player gains a point, thus winning, they converted a break point.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the server in this scenario is one point away from losing; they are facing a break point. If they were to gain a point and keep the game going, it would be considered a break point saved.</p>

<h3 id="the-data">The Data</h3>

<p>The dataset I analyzed contained 1,721 entries, spread out over the years 2009-2017. After an exploratory analysis, I decided to explore how winnings changed over the years.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/lemonmeringuepi/Tennis-Stats/blob/master/winnings-by-year.png?raw=true" alt="Nine histograms, depicting tennis winnings by for the years 2009-2017. The histograms are blue with an orange vertical line and a green vertical line for each yearly median and mean, respectively." title="Tennis Winnings by Year" /></p>

<p>The median yearly winnings– the orange line on each graph– seemed more representative of each year’s winnings. So, I used the median yearly winnings to predict median winnings in subsequent years. If we weren’t in the middle of a global pandemic, median tennis player winnings would be $263,000 this year!</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/lemonmeringuepi/Tennis-Stats/blob/master/median-tennis-winnings.png?raw=true" alt="A scatterplot with blue points to show median yearly winnings for the years 2009-2017, with an orange line of best fit extending through the year 2020." title="Median Tennis Winnings by Year" /></p>

<h4 id="break-points-1">Break Points</h4>

<p>If you’re like me, my scatterplots about break points have you sitting on the edge of your seat and holding your breath the same way that a tennis fan does when watching an actual break point. I mean, look at all of that information!</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/lemonmeringuepi/Tennis-Stats/blob/master/break-points-vs-winnings.png?raw=true" alt="A set of four scatterplots with the title, &quot;Break Points vs. Winnings.&quot; The top left scatterplot depicts break points converted along the x-axis; its data is clustered with winnings ranging from about $0-1100000 around 40% break points converted, with outliers making significantly less money from 0-100%. The top right scatterplot depicts break points saved along the x-axis; its data is clustered with winnings ranging from about $0-1100000 around 60% break points saved, with outliers making significantly less money from 0-100%. The bottom left scatterplot depicts break points opportunities (ranging from 0-600) along the x-axis, with an orange line of best fit showing a trend with a positive slope. The bottom right scatterplot depicts break points faced (ranging from 0-600) along the x-axis, with an orange line of best fit showing a trend with a positive slope." title="Break Points vs. Winnings" /></p>

<p>We can already tell that more break points opportunities and break points faced mean more winnings. Higher numbers of break points opportunities translated to about $15,500-17,000 more yearly winnings than their underdog counterparts, but both sets of players had the potential to win a lot of money.</p>

<p>We can also see that very few tennis players converted or saved 100% of their break points. They were actually more likely to win more if they converted around 40% and saved around 60% of break points. Judging by this, you can make one of two (or both!) assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tennis players who played more games, thus facing more break points, were more likely to earn more money.</li>
  <li>Because the typical break point converted/saved split was roughly 40/60% and it showed significantly more potential for higher winnings, tennis players who played longer games with more break points had a tendency to make more money.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="first-serves">First Serves</h4>

<p>I wanted to know if first serves generally affected the outcome of games, and if that translated to better rankings and winnings. Tennis players with a higher percent of first serve points won won more games, with players that earned 80% of their first serve points winning nearly all of their service games. Players earning first serve return points, however, were much less likely to win a large portion of return games, even though more first serve return points did translate to better performance.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/lemonmeringuepi/Tennis-Stats/blob/master/pct-first-serve-vs-games-won.png?raw=true" alt="Two scatterplots with the title, &quot;Percentage of First Serve Points vs Games.&quot; The scatterplot on the left depicts first serve points won along the x-axis. The domain is from about 50-80% first serve points with the range from about 30-95% service games won. The scatterplot on the right depicts first serve return points won along the x-axis. The domain is from about 10-40% first serve return points and the range is from about 0-45% return games won." title="Percentage of First Serve Points vs Games Won" /></p>

<h3 id="predictions">Predictions</h3>

<p>With the understanding that a better ranking, more break points opportunities (on both sides), and more first serve and first serve return points won meant more winnings, and that winnings increased as time went on, I was able to train a model to predict yearly winnings. With an 84% accuracy, it’s pretty accurate!</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/lemonmeringuepi/Tennis-Stats/blob/master/actual-vs-predicted-winnings.png?raw=true" alt="A scatterplot with the title, &quot;Actual vs Predicted Winnings.&quot; It shows that most of the points (actual, predicted) lie on the line of best fit, y=x. As predicted winnings rise, they points deviate slightly lower than the line." title="Actual vs Predicted Winnings" /></p>

<p><em>Throughout my analysis, I found that many of the higher-earning tennis players tended to be outliers in other categories, which would explain why the model had difficulty predicting higher winnings.</em></p>

<p>For fun, I decided to use my model to predict what I could win in a year of playing tennis. I’m being optimistic that we might have a vaccine next year, which would hypothetically give me time to practice my serve. Based on my athletic aptitude, I placed myself below the worst-ranked tennis player in my data: Rhyne Williams. That poor guy just couldn’t catch a break! I also assumed that even if I practiced day and night until the next tournament, I still wouldn’t stand much of a chance against a professional athelete. These are the fields I input into the model:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Year</td>
      <td>2021</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ranking</td>
      <td>1444</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>BreakPointsOpportunities</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>BreakPointsFaced</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>FirstServePointsWon</td>
      <td>0.16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>FirstServeReturnPointsWon</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Mind you, these stats are abysmal. I honestly expected to come up in the negative, but would you believe that I would win around $4,600 with something like this? Of course, that’s yearly winnings and it doesn’t take into account entry fees, uniforms, travel, and equipment.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m better off sticking to data science.</p>
