I"Æ<h2 id="i-did-it">I did it!</h2>

<p>On December 31st, 2019, my wife, Kara, looked at me and said, â€œYou know, you would like programming.â€ At the same time, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> was having their New Years sale. I decided to give it a go. After all, I had just had knee surgery a few months prior and was still a little laid up. I needed something to do while Kara took our toddler to the trampoline park on weekends and I had exhausted my supply of video games.</p>

<p>I took a quiz to see what I would like and landed on back-end development with JavaScript. Within a week, I was raving about it to everyone who would listen. I told an old friend of mine that it was like a language and a math puzzle had a baby. Sheâ€™s a data scientist and had some casual words of advice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œThatâ€™s a good way to look at it. If you start doing data science stuff it starts to feel even more like that.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More math? Heck, yeah! I switched to the Data Science career path that night. My friend was right. After that, I found myself telling my wife at every step of the way, â€œI like this module. I think this is my favorite. I could totally do this for a living.â€</p>

<p>And so it went, me finding my next favorite thing about data science over and over again, until I got to the <a href="/project/okc-analysis">OKCupid capstone project</a>. It took a while with a toddlerâ€“ I felt like I was working two days on and five offâ€“, but I guess thatâ€™s what you get when youâ€™re a stay at home mom during a global pandemic. The more work I did, though, the more I wanted to do. In the end, it wound up being a behemoth of a project and I <em>loved</em> it.</p>
