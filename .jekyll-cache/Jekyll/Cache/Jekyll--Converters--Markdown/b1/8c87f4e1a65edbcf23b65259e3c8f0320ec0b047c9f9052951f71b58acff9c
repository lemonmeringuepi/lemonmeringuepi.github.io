I"—<h2 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h2>

<p>I am a self taught data scientist in Baltimore, Maryland. Originally, I was a jack-of-all trades. I obtained my Bachelor of Arts in Spanish Literature at Towson University in 2013. Since then, I have had experience teaching mathematics, special eduction, and English as a second language; copyediting; teaching adults about sexuality and consent; and working in data entry in medicine and academia. My first forays into programming began after I had spent a year and a half home with my amazing toddler. I decided to take a JavaScript course on <a href="https://codecademy.com" title="Codecademy's Home Page">Codecademy</a> just to see what it was like. When I raved to a friend that programming is basically just a combination between mathematics and languageâ€“ two things that I love very deeplyâ€“, she recommended I look into data science. From my very first SQL query, I knew I had found something to be passionate about.</p>

<p>Since that first course, I have studied SQL and Python, including libraries like</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Scipy</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
  <li>Seaborn</li>
  <li>Beautiful Soup</li>
  <li>Sklearn</li>
</ul>

<p>I am at my happiest working within a Jupyter Notebook, but am just as content to plug away at application logic in a text editor or to run code within Terminal. Codecademy has been my primary massive open online course (MOOC), and I have also taken courses through <a href="https://academy.zenva.com" title="Zenva Academy's Home Page">Zenva Academy</a> and studied various math and programming texts from publishers like <a href="https://www.manning.com/" title="Manning's Home Page">Manning Publications</a>, <a href="https://nostarch.com/" title="No Starch Press's Home Page">No Starch Press</a>, and <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/" title="O'Reilly Media's Home Page">Oâ€™Reilly</a>.</p>
