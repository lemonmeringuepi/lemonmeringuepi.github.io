I"Ê<h2 id="i-did-it">I did it!</h2>

<p>On December 31st, 2019, my wife, Kara, looked at me and said, ‚ÄúYou know, you would like programming.‚Äù At the same time, <a href="http://ssqt.co/mQfKjjI">Codecademy</a> was having their New Years sale. I decided to give it a go. After all, I had just had knee surgery a few months prior and was still a little laid up. I needed something to do while Kara took our toddler to the trampoline park on weekends and I had exhausted my supply of video games.</p>

<p>I took a quiz to see what I would like and landed on back-end development with JavaScript. Within a week, I was raving about it to everyone who would listen. I told an old friend of mine that it was like a language and a math puzzle had a baby. She‚Äôs a data scientist and had some casual words of advice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good way to look at it. If you start doing data science stuff it starts to feel even more like that.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More math? Heck, yeah! I switched to the Data Science career path that night. My friend was right. After that, I found myself telling my wife at every step of the way, ‚ÄúI like this module. I think this is my favorite. I could totally do this for a living.‚Äù</p>

<p>And so it went, me finding my next favorite thing about data science over and over again, until I got to the <a href="/project/okc-analysis">OKCupid capstone project</a>. It took a while with a toddler‚Äì I felt like I was working two days on and five off‚Äì, but I guess that‚Äôs what you get when you‚Äôre a stay at home mom during a global pandemic. The more work I did, though, the more I wanted to do. In the end, it wound up being a behemoth of a project and I <em>loved</em> it.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs more? After all of that work (and the weekend to recharge and celebrate my birthday), returning to my lessons was a breeze. I finished the remainder of the Data Science career track, Natural Language Processing, in an afternoon. When I finished, the website awarded me with this cute certificate of completion.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs next?</h2>

<p>Over the course of the past nine months, I collected a mountain of digital textbooks and video courses. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription?refc=LT9fcU">HumbleBundle</a> has filled my Calibre library to the brim with 253 new books, 134 of them about math, physics, coding, data, statistics, and probability. On top of that, I have a slew of Zenva and Manning courses, CompTIA and AWS exam guides, and three months left of my Codecademy subscription. The world is my oyster.</p>

<p>So what will I do now? I really enjoyed both visualization and NLP. My first course of action will be to complete Codecademy‚Äôs Learn Natural Language Processing course, which expands upon the NLP modules I completed in the Data Science career path. After that, I see a few options:</p>
