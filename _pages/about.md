## Beginnings

I am a self taught data scientist in Baltimore, Maryland. Originally, I was a jack-of-all trades. I obtained my Bachelor of Arts in Spanish Literature at Towson University in 2013. Since then, I have had experience teaching mathematics, special eduction, and English as a second language; copyediting; teaching adults about sexuality and consent; and working in data entry in medicine and academia. My first forays into programming began after I had spent a year and a half home with my amazing toddler. I decided to take a JavaScript course on [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com "Codecademy's Home Page") just to see what it was like. When I raved to a friend that programming is basically just a combination between mathematics and language-- two things that I love very deeply--, she recommended I look into data science. From my very first SQL query, I knew I had found something to be passionate about.

## Education

Since that first course, I have studied SQL and Python, including libraries like

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Beautiful Soup
* Sklearn

I am at my happiest working within a Jupyter Notebook, but am just as content to plug away at application logic in a text editor or to run code within Terminal. Codecademy has been my primary massive open online course (MOOC), and I have also taken courses through [Zenva Academy](https://academy.zenva.com "Zenva Academy's Home Page") and studied various math and programming texts from publishers like [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/ "Manning's Home Page"), [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/ "No Starch Press's Home Page"), and [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/ "O'Reilly Media's Home Page").
